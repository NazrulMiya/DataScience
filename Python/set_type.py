# A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects
''' Hashable Object: An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime
    (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.
    Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member, because these data structures use the hash value internally.'''
# Most of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable
# Mutable Data Types such as List, Dictionary are not hashable.
# the order of elements in a set is undefined
# Set Type is mutable means we can add or remove elements from set.
# set is created using {}
# set is mutable but individual elements ins set are immutable
